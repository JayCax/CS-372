# Pokemon.

README 

The program was done in Python3 (Python 3.8 , specifically) on PyCharm. 
finalProjectServer, finalProjectClient, Pokemon and commonFunctions need to all be in the same directory. 
Afterwards, all that is needed is to simply run finalProjectServer to create the socket, 
then subsequently finalProjectClient and switch terminals 
between them back and forth in order to proceed with the socket communication via the Pokemon battle between them.
