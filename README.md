Portfolio Client-Server Chat Project: A Pokemon Battle Simulator Across a Socket Connection 

"""
README 

The program was done in Python3 (Python 3.8 , specifically) on PyCharm. 
finalProjectServer, finalProjectClient, Pokemon and commonFunctions need to all be in the same directory. 
Afterwards, all that is needed is to simply run finalProjectServer to create the socket, 
then subsequently finalProjectClient and switch terminals 
between them back and forth in order to proceed with the socket communication via the Pokemon battle between them.  

NOTE: I decided to do the Extra Credit option of making a Pokemon battle program between client and server across the socket connection. The Pokemon class file facilitates the Pokemon object in the client and server-side
